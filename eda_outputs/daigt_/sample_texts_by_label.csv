Thomas Jefferson believed that the key to getting tasks done was to strike a balance between constant work and rest. Taking time to rest was vital in order to refresh memories, perfect ideas, and help alleviate the temptation of overthinking small matters. By ensuring that one is taking the time to rest, it is easier to tackle tasks with the appropriate frame of mind and boost efficiency. As Jefferson once said, ""Never take more time and pains than is necessary for a thing - the genuine wisdom is in taking the shortest way."" It is important to find a balance between staying busy and taking time to rest to avoid feeling overwhelmed and overstressed. Rest is essential to enable focused, intentional work.",1

School districts across the country are now offering shorter pathways for high school students, allowing them to graduate in three instead of four years. This ambitious proposal, while it has its drawbacks, is not without its benefits. Those who complete the three-year program can achieve financial independence earlier by starting their career or college sooner, and have more time to acquire valuable life experience during the duration of their studies.

The primary concern of such accelerated programs is that students may not have enough time to truly devote to their studies, and could be overwhelmed by heavy course loads and a truncated timeline. In order to ensure students are retaining their education, some school districts may have to reduce the number of extracurricular activities and limit certain subjects, such as science or foreign language. 

While there will always be pros and cons associated with any program, the potential benefits of offering shorter pathways for high school students cannot be ignored. By pursuing such accelerated studies, students can work towards financial independence, receive the life experience they need for career or college success, and further their education with more opportunities for advanced training.",1

The beach and the outdoors present a wide variety of activities for everyone to enjoy. Going to the community park can be a great way to unwind, with lots of opportunities to meet new people, take your dog for a walk, and get some fresh air. Training a dog can be both a challenging and rewarding activity, and you'll be able to watch your furry companion learn new tricks and skills. If you have a dog—or want to make one—making friends with other dogs is also a great way to spend time outdoors.

At the beach, there are more opportunities to relax and clear your mind. Take a walk and enjoy the surf, the sun, and the sand between your toes; go swimming, surfing, or paddleboarding; or just sit by the shore and reflect, letting the sound of the waves slow your breathing and soothe your soul. If you're looking for someone to connect with, the beach is also a great place to meet people and make friends.",1

"In my oppinon school is good how it is now. having go to go school for a couple of months straight across and then just have a couple of months off for summer. If they were to change the school routine to kids having to have breaks for 3-4 week's they wouldn't come back with the same effort as they do when they come back off of summer break.. For example if I were to leave shcool for 3-4 weeks I wouldn't want to come back to the same classes and with the same routine, It's just that Students do retain the information they teach they would have to go over it just so they get back on track. But the fact of having year-around school isn't it just doesn't make a diffrence. and im an sure that kids wouldn't like to have only 3-4 weeks off school after all the time they spend in school

This is why students should have a right amount of school and a certain amount of months off. a year-around school benifits teachers not students. because they if they did have a year- around teachers wouldn't have to worry about re-teahing it again to the students because they would expect them to already know what they are taking about. so they should have a regualr schedual for te schools board to follow.

But at the same time the fact of not having to go to school for weeks sounds good. when their break is over they would have to go back to school not only that but they would have to pick up from where the left off at first. I feel like leaving in the middle of a lesson that is important that really wouldn't have the studets as much. if they were to change the school routine it would just mess things up with the students and their grades and that would e more work of teachers. What if some important test is coming up for the students and they only have a certian amount of time to get things done within the time period and then they would leave on break what if the teacher couldnt get everything done in time then te whole class would fail the test.

This is why they should just leave school as it is just so that student's and teacher's wouldn't have to go throught all that trouble, Just get what they need to get done within the time they are their and then when they are done with all the work they needed to get done with they could leave for summer break, just so students dont stress over the facts that they have to get things done in a certain amout of time. These are some of the many reasons why they should have school for months and not take breaks inbetween school days just so that they have months off on their summer break. ",0
"Some People Believe in praising a student's work to build self-esteem,even if the work is not the students best effort. they believe that students must be self confident to learn.

I do not, i believe that if you give a student false praise then the student is going to get lazy & stop producing work with the quality and efficiency that they used too.

In truth I was just like this, I once had a teacher who put so much false hope and praise in me that i started to not care as much as i used too, it effected my social life & determination as well as my standards, intent & self-esteem, I was no longer able to spend more than five minutes on work without getting distracted or discouraged, eventually i came to terms with the fact that not all my work was gonna be perfect, but if i spent enough time on it then it would be a hundred times better.

So what is the best way to build self-esteem, well that would be hard work and dedication, lots of people think that just because they do some work they should instantly be rewarded, there work does not even need to be good, for them to think they deserve praise.

The best way to actually build confidence is through achievement's,when you accomplish something and you do it well you get this since of success unlike the half baked work most people get credit for.

Once you actually build up confidence everything in life gets easier, you start doing your home work on time, when a test comes up you would be very well prepared to get an A, your friends and teachers start to respect you more & your parents will be proud of you, but most importantly you will be proud of yourself.

In conclusion having false praise & hope is bad it lowers your standards and makes your work ethic terrible the only good way to build self-esteem is through achieving something out of hard word and dedication.",0
